    "feedback": "The handwriting is generally clear with some letters standing out more than others. The capital letters like 'T', 'O', and 'P' are particularly well-formed and consistent. However, some of the lowercase letters like 'y', 'g', and 'o' could be made clearer, as they tend to lose definition. Overall, there's a good level of uniformity in the slant and spacing, giving the text a neat appearance."
